                <p class="project__description--text">Lets say that you have a farm of apples, and 30 people are working on that farm.
                    You decided to pay those people according to amount they have farmed. Instead of writing down on a papper each person (employee) 
                    name and then measuring the weight of the crate, writing down how much of each variety you got, you can scan barcodes just like in a store, and 
                    stop worrying about anything else.
                    <br><br>
                    There is much more, but about that in a <span>challenge</span>.

            <p class="project__challenge--text">
                This project was made for a friend of mine. Everything started with a simple idea. He wanted an app that 
                can scan barcode of a crate and enter the weight once you measure it. If you scan same barcode again, then previous
                 weight should be shown with a option to update it. It was about blueberries. As i started creating an app, i also started asking questons.<br>
                 <span class="harvest--question">Would you like to know who is the person who farmed the crate?</span><br> So he replied 
                 <span class="harvest--reply">"Well maybe someone will be curious and ask me how much he farmed, i don't know, why not."</span>
                  So i added that option.<br> <span class="harvest--question">Is there just one variety of blueberrie, or more?</span> 
                  <span class="harvest--reply">"Well two at the moment, Duke and Draper".</span> 
                  <br> <span class="harvest--question">Since you are farming on few different places, would you like to know witch place is giving you the most?</span>
                  <span class="harvest--reply">"That would be great".</span>
                  <br> <span class="harvest--question">What if you want to check data from yesterday, would you like option for that?</span>
                  <span class="harvest--reply">"You are enjoying this app more then i do, do it".</span>
                  <br> <span class="harvest--question">What if barcode scanner stops working at some point, it would be nice to have a backup plan that is good too?</span>
                  <span class="harvest--reply">"Never thought of that, sure".</span>
                  <br>
                  But the challenge comes later. Crates for blueberries are small, so he was printing around 15 barcodes per person. So one day when one of the employees decided to 
                  quit, he ended up with around 10 barcodes printed for that person. If he delete an employee from app, barcodes are invalid, and if he just give those crates to anyone else,
                   the data won't be correct. So i needed to implement an option to transfer all printed barcodes from one employee to other, and that was a huge app refactoring.
                   Yes, you must plan everything, allways...
